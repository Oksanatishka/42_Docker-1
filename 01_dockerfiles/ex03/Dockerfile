# Docker can be useful to test an application thatâ€™s still being developed without polluting your libraries. 
# You will have to design a Dockerfile that gets the development
# version of Gitlab - Community Edition installs it with all the dependencies and the necessary configurations, 
# and launches the application, all as it builds.
