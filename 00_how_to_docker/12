# Launch a mysql container as a background task. It should be able to restart on its
# own in case of error, and the root password of the database should be Kerrigan.
# You will also make sure that the database is stored in the hatchery volume, that
# the container directly creates a database named zerglings, and that the container
# itself is named spawning-pool.

docker run -d --name spawning-pool --restart on-failure --env MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD='Kerrigan' -v hatchery:/var/lib/mysql --env MYSQL_DATABASE='zerglings' mysql
