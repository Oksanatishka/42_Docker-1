# From the shell of a debian container, install via the containerâ€™s package manager
# everything you need to compile C source code and push it onto a git repo (of
# course, make sure before that the package manager and the packages already in the
# container are updated). For this exercise, you should only specify the commands
# to be run directly in the container.

apt-get update -y
apt-get install git -y
apt-get install gcc -y

# p.s. run the command not the script.
# Start Debian container: docker run -ti --rm debian

# apt-get - APT package handling utility - command-line interface
# update - Used to re-synchronize the package index files from their sources.
# upgrade - Used to install the newest versions of all packages currently installed on the system 
# from the sources enumerated in /etc/apt/sources.list
# install pkg(s) - This option is followed by one or more packages desired for installation. 
# -y, --yes, --assume-yes - Automatic yes to prompts.
