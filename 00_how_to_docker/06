# Launch an nginx container, available on Docker Hub, as a background task. It
# should be named overlord, be able to restart on its own, and have its 80 port
# attached to the 5000 port of Char. You can check that your container functions
# properly by visiting
# http://<ip-de-char>:5000 on your web browser.

docker run -d -p 5000:80 --name overlord --restart=always nginx

# -d, --detach — Run container in background and print container ID.
# --name string — Assign a name to the container.
# -p, --publish list — Publish a container's port(s) to the host.
